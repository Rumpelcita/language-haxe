# Haxe language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to Haxe files in Atom.

from the [Haxe TextMate bundle](https://github.com/jdonaldson/HaXe.tmbundle).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
